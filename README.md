# Description and Features
AzerPUG's Chat Improvements let's you define a nickname that will automatically be in front of the messages you type. If you are on an alt or just want to add your standard name to a message, this will help you make that a lot easier.  
The addon also automatically blocks A LOT of spam from any chats you are in. Automatically blocking messages containing multiple phrases containing clear indication that some one is spamming chat for boosting communities. These messages will simply be filtered and not displayed.
